# My non-FOSS Alternatives for Android

It's gonna happen, right? Some apps just don't quite hit the mark on the search for FOSS alternatives.

## Audio/Video Players

- [Plexamp](https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/) - Plex is a descendent of XBMC[^1] and Plexamp is their offering to stream music from your media server.

## Creative

- [LumaFusion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.luma_touch.lumafusion "Play Store") - Multi-track video editing

## Reading

- [Libby](https://libbyapp.com) - support your local library by borrowing eBooks, audio books, magazines, and plenty more. [^2]
- [Kobo app](https://www.kobo.com/) - the alternative to Amazon for purchasing eBooks and audio books.
  - I also have a Kobo eReader and have connected it to [OverDrive] to borrow books

## Productivity

- [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) - Free and powerful note-taking app with good organisation and stylus support.[^3]

## Navigation

- [MagicEarth](https://www.magicearth.com/) - Very capable and privacy-friendly app, which works with [Android Auto].
