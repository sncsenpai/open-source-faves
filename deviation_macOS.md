# My non-FOSS Alternatives for macOS

This is a list of propietary software that I decided to use rather than going for FLOSS.

## Creative

- [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) - video production software with video editing and composition, and audio editing capabilities.
- [Affinity Photo] - brilliant and affordable alternative to [Adobe Photoshop]. [^1]

## Communication

- [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/) - free cross-platform app to hold all your chats in one app. [^3] 

## Productivity

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - has a freemium model and I have actually paid for the Powerpack. I did make my own snippets to use with it ([Special Characters] and [Fraction Shortcuts]).
- [Typora](https://typora.io/) - Markdown editor with a very simple UI that has real-time preview and can export in multiple formats (using [Pandoc]).[^2]

## Utilities

- [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) - snap windows into organised tiles to manage your workspace.[^4]

[Adobe Photoshop]: https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html
[Pandoc]: https://pandoc.org/
[Franz]: https://meetfranz.com/
[Rambox]: https://rambox.app/
[^1]: While [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is very powerful, I'm held back by my familiarity with [Adobe Photoshop]. [Affinity Photo] is not free, but it is a fantastic alternative.
[^2]: This is not free, but I am currently assessing some FOSS alternatives.
[^3]: I used [Franz] a while back but it's now following a commercial model and the free version is way too limited. [Rambox] is similar and no longer open source.
[^4]: I discovered [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) a bit too late. While open source, you can pay for a more "pro" version.
