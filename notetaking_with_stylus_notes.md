## Observations

- Not all subscription notes were easily identifiable on the websites, but available as a purchase through the respective app stores.
- Some apps are only available on Apple devices.
- Weirdness from Samsung to access Notes on a Windows device manufactured by them. The steps documented on XDA Developers[^5] for Windows 10 worked for me on Windows 11.
- I'm looking for something that has cross-platform support.
- Joplin does support using a stylus but doesn't work with my madness.

## Final choice

I finally settled on OneNote. It's cross-platform, has a web-clipper, supports my devices (S22 Ultra, Tab S8 Ultra, Macbook Pro, and Windows PC), and I really like the hierarchical way to organise my sections, notebooks and pages. Plus, the ink-to-writing is awesome!
