# My non-FOSS Alternatives for macOS

This is a list of propietary software that I decided to use rather than going for FLOSS.

## Creative

- [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) - video production software with video editing and composition, and audio editing capabilities.
- [Affinity Photo] - brilliant and affordable alternative to [Adobe Photoshop]. [^1]

## Productivity

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - has a freemium model and I have actually paid for the Powerpack. I did make my own snippets to use with it ([Special Characters] and [Fraction Shortcuts]).

## Utilities

- [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) - snap windows into organised tiles to manage your workspace.

[Affinity Photo]: https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/
[Adobe Photoshop]: https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html
[^1]: While [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is very powerful, I'm held back by my familiarity with [Adobe Photoshop]. [Affinity Photo] is not free, but it is a fantastic alternative.
