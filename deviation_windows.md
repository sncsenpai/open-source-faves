# My non-FOSS Alternatives for Microsoft Windows

This is a list of free but propietary software that I decided to use rather than going for FLOSS. Please don't take this as a negative reflection on FOSS software, but more of what suits my needs.

## Creative

- [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) - video production software with video editing and composition, and audio editing capabilities.
- [Affinity Photo] - brilliant and affordable alternative to [Adobe Photoshop]. [^1]

## Productivity

- [pdfGear](https://www.pdfgear.com/) - it may not be on par with Adobe Acrobat but is still a very powerful PDF editor.
- [Typora](https://typora.io/) - Markdown editor with a very simple UI that has real-time preview and can export in multiple formats (using [Pandoc]).[^2]
- [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) - Cross-platform, cloud-based, and collaborative. Can easily move between the desktop and tablet.
- [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) - web-based diagramming tool which is much more feature rich than the web-based Visio.
  - Offline downloads of the app are available.

## Communication

- [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/) - free cross-platform app to hold all your chats in one app. [^3] 

## Security

- [AdwCleaner](https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner) - junkware and adware removal tool.

## Utilities

- [HiBit Uninstaller](https://hibitsoft.ir/Uninstaller.html) - thoroughly uninstall software from your machine
- [ClipClip](https://clipclip.com/) - clipboard manager. It is very close to how I use [Clipy] on macOS.
- [Keka](https://www.keka.io/) - file archiver with 7z support.

[Clippy]: https://clipy-app.com/
[Pandoc]: https://pandoc.org/
[Affinity Photo]: https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/
[Adobe Photoshop]: https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html
[Franz]: https://meetfranz.com/
[Rambox]: https://rambox.app/
[^1]: While [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is very powerful, I'm held back by my familiarity with [Adobe Photoshop]. [Affinity Photo] is not free, but it is a fantastic alternative.
[^2]: This is not free, but I am currently assessing some FOSS alternatives.
[^3]: I used [Franz] a while back but it's now following a commercial model and the free version is way too limited. [Ramboz] is similar and no longer open source.
