# Free/Open Source Applications for Linux

Okay. This is gonna be very subjective given there are different bases such as Debian, Fedora, etc (don't get me started on Snap vs Flatpack). For context, I'm using Zorin OS but you may like something else. 

Here, I will present my list of favourite FOSS software I use on Zorin.
