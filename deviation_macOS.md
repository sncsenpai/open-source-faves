# My non-FOSS Alternatives for macOS

This is a list of propietary software that I decided to use rather than going for FLOSS.

## Productivity

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - has a freemium model and I have actually paid for the Powerpack. I did make my own snippets to use with it ([Special Characters] and [Fraction Shortcuts]).

## Utilities

- [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) - snap windows into organised tiles to manage your workspace.
